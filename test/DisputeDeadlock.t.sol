/// @title A dispute nobody resolves, in a deal nobody gave a tribunal
/// @notice The Core dispute equilibrium (PLURISWAP.md Parte IV, 2026-09-24).
/// @dev Two parties who sign a deal without ARBITRATION chose, together, to have nobody decide. When one of
///      them freezes the trade, the kernel makes sure that NO ONE can profit from the freeze:
///
///      * no split after a dispute — the only agreements left are all-or-nothing: mutual cancel (all to
///        the Holder) or co-signed release (all to the Provider). "Give me half or we both lose it" is not
///        an offer the kernel will execute;
///      * the clock burns everything — the principal to a dead address, both bonds to the sink, both
///        scores marked. Mutually assured destruction.
///
///      Together they make surrender every cheater's best reply. A Provider who marked fiat without paying
///      gets 0 by signing the cancel and loses his bond by waiting; a Holder who was paid and disputed gets
///      0 by signing the release and loses her bond (and the crypto she already sold) by waiting. The price
///      is stated rather than hidden: facing a spiteful cheater, or an honest partner in a genuine
///      disagreement, the principal is lost. That is the deal the parties signed when they chose no
///      tribunal, and it is why a deal that matters selects ARBITRATION.

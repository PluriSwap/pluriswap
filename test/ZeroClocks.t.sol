///      belong to the parties and the signature covers them. A kernel with a minimum would be a
///      kernel with an opinion about how long a bank transfer takes.

///      But a zero clock is not a short clock — it hands one side a free win, and all four are
///      reachable with terms both parties legitimately signed. These tests are the ground truth
///      behind the client-side review (`lab/src/consent/termsReview.ts`), which is the only thing
///      standing between a person and a signature that gives away their principal. If the kernel's
///      behaviour here ever changes, the review's claims are wrong and these fail first.

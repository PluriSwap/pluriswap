// The sparse tree an account keeps of its own counterparties (§3.14.7 anti-farming, 2026-09-23).
//
// Different animal from `merkle.ts`'s incremental tree, and for a reason: that one is append-only and
// a contract owns it, so a leaf's position is whatever the next index happens to be. This one is
// addressed by CONTENT — a counterparty's slot is `cpPath(S_other)`, the low 32 bits of a hash — so
// that a claim cannot point its non-membership proof at whatever empty slot it likes. Nobody owns it:
// it lives as a root inside the account's own leaf, and only the claim circuit ever updates it.
//
// Sparse means almost every slot is the zero subtree, so the root and any path are computed from the
// handful of entries that exist plus the precomputed zeros — never by materialising 2^32 leaves.
//
// A collision (two counterparties whose paths agree in all 32 bits) reads as "already known" and
// denies credit. That is the safe direction, and at a few hundred entries it happens with probability
// around 10^-4. The unsafe direction — a known counterparty reading as fresh — would need a Poseidon
// preimage, not a birthday.

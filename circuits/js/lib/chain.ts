// The chain-consistency reference lib of the disclosure layer (PLURISWAP.md §3.15.7, F4
// as-built). A consumer asking "how has this account behaved over time" receives a
// SEQUENCE of attestations — a disclosure the account owner chose to give, each element
// a true statement about a real state of the account tree. This lib certifies the
// consistency of WHAT WAS DELIVERED:
//
//   * every element verifies (proof + its own semantic checks, via verify.ts);
//   * ONE handleCommit across the whole series — one account's disclosure, not a
//     splice of several (the handle is the only continuity the chain has: the §3.15.7
//     model is states, not events, so nothing else binds the series together);
//   * the RAW counters are component-wise monotone NON-DECREASING in the order given:
//     count (attest_base's claim and reveal_advanced's `out_count` are the SAME counter),
//     volume where revealed, and the penalty — which every reveal states raw (§3.15.7 keeps
//     it outside the mask). §3.15.5's deltas only ever ADD — a decreasing element is a
//     fabricated sequence, and this is the check that catches it;
//   * the PENALTY BAND of a listing is checked against the exact penalties already revealed
//     earlier in the series: a reveal is exact and a band claim must COVER the account's real
//     one, so a listing claiming a band under evidence the same series already handed over is
//     inconsistent with itself. (The other direction is allowed and not flagged — an
//     overstated band is a true if unflattering statement, and it only ever costs its author.)
//
// What this lib deliberately does NOT do:
//   * the TIER is not monotone — a Stalemate (+5) can drop a T2 account to T1 mid-chain,
//     and an honest chain shows exactly that; checking tiers for decrease would reject
//     the honest case the design wants visible;
//   * the GAPS are not priced here — the user's selection freedom (which elements to
//     hand over) is bounded only by the consumer's own receipts: verifyAttestationChain
//     certifies what arrived, the cadence policy (and the price of a missing month) is
//     the consumer's, per §3.15.7's "el listado muestra attestations frescas".
//
// Pure logic over verify.ts — no bb, no chain reads the consumer did not inject.

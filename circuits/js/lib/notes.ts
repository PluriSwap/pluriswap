// Recovering a private VAULT from its secret and the chain — the notes half of what
// `account.ts` does for the reputation leaf, and the reason the note salts became derived
// (§3.15.6, 2026-09-23).
//
// A note holds tokens and its salt is what spends it (`nullBond` is taken over the salt), so a
// salt that only lived in a client's local state was money that died with a laptop. The rule the
// circuits now enforce: A NOTE'S SALT DERIVES FROM WHATEVER THE NOTE CAME FROM.
//
//   deposit   no parent      seed = a small per-account index (the circuit binds it under 2^32)
//   split     prepare_bond   the change's seed = the nullifier the split published
//   withdraw  withdraw       the change's seed = the nullifier the withdraw published
//   reabsorb  reabsorb       the merged note's seed = the released lock's nullifier
//   lock      prepare_bond   the earmark's salt = derived from the DEAL (one lock per deal)
//
// That closes the salts. The AMOUNTS close too, and by the same accident of design: every
// transition publishes its own delta — a deposit publishes `(token, amount)`, a withdraw its
// `amount`, a split its `lockAmount`, a reabsorb the record's `amount`. So a child's amount is its
// parent's minus something the chain states, and the walk bottoms out at deposits, which are
// public in full. Salts derived + amounts derivable = the vault is reconstructible from `sk_id`
// and the chain, with nothing kept on the side.
//
// This module is the walk, as pure functions over public facts. It reads no chain itself: feed it
// what an indexer saw (`indexer.ts` rebuilds the notes tree exactly as it rebuilds the accounts
// one — same contract shape, depth 20), match each returned commitment against the tree, and the
// ones that are present and unspent are the vault's live balance.

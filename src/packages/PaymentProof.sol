/// @notice The `PAYMENT_PROOF` package (PLURISWAP.md §3.12.1): a deal that selected it ends in a proof
///         of the signed payment or in a timeout. No dispute, no tribunal, no 50/50.
///
/// @dev Rail-agnostic. This contract is what every payment rail shares — the claim, the nullifier, the
///      fee — and the rail itself is the `IPaymentVerifier` named in the `packageId`. Another rail, or
///      the same rail with another trust anchor, is another verifier and therefore another package.
///
///      The claim is the KERNEL's, never the caller's: the deal id the kernel passes, the `fiatCommit`
///      both parties signed, and the activation clock as the earliest a payment may be. The caller
///      only brings the proof. So a proof of a real payment that is not the agreed one — another
///      amount, another account, an old transfer between the same two people — opens another claim,
///      and the adapter says no.
///
///      Custody never passes through here. The kernel charges `verifyFee` and commits `RELEASED` in the
///      same transaction as this call; if anything here reverts, the deal is exactly as it was.

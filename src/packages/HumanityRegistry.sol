///         declared-trust humanity oracle behind the `register` circuits (PLURISWAP.md
///         §3.15.3 "Registro", §3.15.9 V1 as-built).
/// @dev The registry checks the Passport decoder ON-CHAIN AT ENROLL — the one place the
///      anchor is necessarily public: the enrolling wallet IS the anchor, and `enroll` is the
///      decoder's score gate. What the tree stores is NOT the anchor but the identity
///      commitment `PoseidonT2(hsk)` of a per-human secret `hsk` the registry never learns,
///      and one anchor enrolls exactly one commitment (one human, one identity, forever).
///      The `register_humanity` circuit then proves membership of that commitment and derives
///      `hn = PoseidonT3(hsk, registryId)` — deriving hn from the anchor would be enumerable
///      by any decoder observer (the anchor is public here); deriving it from the secret is
///      not: the tree's leaves are one-way in hsk, and hn cannot be recomputed from them.
///
///      `registryId` is a deployment domain (constructor arg, immutable): hn is nullified
///      per registry, so a proof naming a foreign domain fails closed at the adapter. The
///      canonical domain of this protocol is the one pinned in `test/fixtures/vectors.json`
///      (`.registry.registry_id`), the same constant the circuit vectors use.

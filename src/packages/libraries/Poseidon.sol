/// @notice BN254 Poseidon over the pinned poseidon-solidity singletons (PLURISWAP.md §5.1).
/// @dev The protocol does NOT compile poseidon-solidity into this tree. Built with our settings
///      (solc 0.8.28, via_ir, optimizer 200) `PoseidonT3`'s runtime is 29,315 B — 4,739 B past the
///      EIP-170 wall — so a linked library here is a contract no chain enforcing the limit would
///      accept; only a test EVM, which does not enforce it, would let it through. What upstream
///      ships instead is a DEPLOYMENT: a pre-signed CREATE2 blob whose runtime does fit, pushed
///      through Arachnid's deterministic-deployment-proxy to the same address on every EVM. Both
///      singletons are already live on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Sepolia.
///
///      So Poseidon is treated the way the Honk verifiers are (§3.15.9, V1–V3): foreign bytecode
///      we never compile, called by address and selector, never linked. The addresses below are
///      derived — not asserted — by `CREATE2(deployer, salt, initcode)` over the initcode pinned
///      in `lib/poseidon-solidity`, and `test/fixtures/poseidon.json` carries that derivation for
///      the tests, regenerated under a CI drift gate (`bun poseidon:fixture`).
///
///      Fail-closed: a `staticcall` into an address with no code SUCCEEDS with empty returndata,
///      which would silently hash everything to zero. Every call therefore checks the return size,
///      and a chain without the singleton reverts `PoseidonUnavailable` at the first hash — which
///      for `PoseidonTree` is its own constructor.

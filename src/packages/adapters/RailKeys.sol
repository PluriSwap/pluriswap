/// @title RailKeys
/// @notice Which keys count for a deal (PLURISWAP.md §3.12.1, Parte IV 2026-09-24): the adapter's pinned
///         defaults, plus any key the deal's Holder approved for that deal. Every rail adapter inherits it.
///
/// @dev The principle: **whoever a false key would hurt is whoever may vouch for a key.** A false key
///      releases the Holder's crypto against a payment that never happened — it hurts the Holder and
///      nobody else. A missing key strands the Provider's real payment. So the Holder may EXTEND trust
///      for their own deal, and the design is built around two asymmetries:
///
///        * the Holder can extend, never restrict. There is no veto: a Holder able to switch off a genuine
///          pinned key could deny a real payment and take the principal home at the timeout;
///        * nobody else can produce the extension. It is an EIP-712 signature by the `holder` of the signed
///          terms, over (dealId, keyHash), under this adapter's domain — the Provider, the one a false key
///          would pay, cannot make it; nor can it be carried to another deal, another key, another rail.
///
///      What this buys: a rotation no longer needs a redeploy (the Holder's client approves the rail's live
///      key when the deal is signed, after checking it against the rail's DNS itself), and an unplanned
///      rotation mid-deal is rescuable (the Holder approves the new key). There is no registry, no steward,
///      no DAO verb, no tribunal: the only authority in the system is a party over its own risk (II.14).
///
///      Why it is not drift of a live deal (EXT-10): the approval is a post-activation consent by the party
///      at risk, of the same family as `MutualCancel` and `CoSignedRelease` — it names the `dealId`, not
///      the terms. The module's side, what the kernel snapshotted, is unchanged.
///
///      A pool as Holder does not get the extension, on purpose: `Pool.isValidSignature` only validates the
///      digests `authorize` registered, so an approval fails closed. Letting the pool's Controller approve
///      keys would let a Controller and a Provider drain the pool with a false key — and the Controller must
///      never be able to redirect principal. Pool deals run on the pinned defaults, as before.
///
///      No nonce, no deadline, no revocation: an approval only ever widens one deal, it is idempotent, and
///      the deal it names ends.

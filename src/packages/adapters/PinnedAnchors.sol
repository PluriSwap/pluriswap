/// @notice The key rotation policy of `PAYMENT_PROOF` (PLURISWAP.md §3.12.1, Parte IV 2026-09-24), as the
///         base every rail adapter inherits: the trust anchors — a DKIM key, a notary key, a bank's signing
///         key, identified by the hash the rail's circuit exposes — are fixed at deploy, each with a bounded
///         window, and nothing can change them afterwards.
///
/// @dev Why fixed, and not a registry. The adapter's address is inside the ZK `packageId`, so what is
///      pinned here is part of what the three parties signed. A registry that can ADD a key can forge a
///      proof for every live deal under that package — a drain with a signature on it; one that can REMOVE
///      a key can strand every honest Provider mid-deal — a kill switch. Neither survives II.
///
///      So a rotation is publication, not an edit: a new adapter pinning the new key, a new `PaymentProof`,
///      a new `packageId`. Anyone can deploy it (PERM-03). Deals already signed keep the package they signed
///      (EXT-10) and settle under it until its `sunset`; there is nothing to migrate.
///
///      The window does three jobs at once:
///        * the adapter hands the circuit [max(notBefore, validFrom), validUntil] and the circuit proves the
///          payment falls inside — so a key only counts for what it could have signed, and the payment
///          time is never published;
///        * overlapping windows let an adapter pin the current key AND a pre-published successor, which is
///          how a planned rotation crosses a live deal without stranding it;
///        * `MAX_WINDOW` bounds a leaked key with no governance at all: even a package nobody maintains
///          stops trusting a key after at most thirteen months.
///
///      These are the DEFAULTS: the keys that count with nobody doing anything. What they cannot cover — a
///      rotation nobody pinned, including one in the middle of a live deal — `RailKeys` covers with the
///      Holder's own approval, per deal. Adapters inherit `RailKeys`, not this contract directly.

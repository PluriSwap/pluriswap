/// @notice Walks a subject up the tier ladder on chain and narrates what the cap does at each step.
/// @dev The reputation package is the one part of the protocol whose behaviour is a *curve* rather
///      than a transition, so no single deal shows what it does. This runs the curve: it earns the
///      tiers, hits the two refusals that surprise people, shows what a bond adds, and then throws
///      it away with one deadlock.
///
///      Every subject is salted per run (`LADDER_RUN`, default the block timestamp), so the script
///      is repeatable on a chain that already has history — you can run it, look at it, and run it
///      again without the previous walk polluting the numbers.
///
///      Reading the output is the point; the `require`s are there so it is also a test.

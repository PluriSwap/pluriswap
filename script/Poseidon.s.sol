/// @title PoseidonEnsurer
/// @notice Puts the pinned poseidon-solidity singletons on a chain that does not have them yet
///         (PLURISWAP.md §5.1). Idempotent: a singleton that already has code is left alone.
/// @dev The private layer hashes through fixed addresses, never through a library linked into this
///      tree — our own build of `PoseidonT3` is 29,315 B, past EIP-170. Those addresses are the
///      CREATE2 of upstream's pre-signed initcode through Arachnid's deterministic-deployment-proxy,
///      so ensuring them is exactly: send `salt || initcode` to the proxy and check where it landed.
///
///      On Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Sepolia `PoseidonT3` is already live; `PoseidonT2` is not, so
///      this runs once per chain before anything in the private layer is deployed. Deploying the
///      proxy itself is deliberately NOT this script's job: it is a keyless Nick's-method deployment
///      with its own pre-signed transaction, so a missing proxy fails loudly here rather than being
///      papered over with a different factory — which would mean different addresses.
///
///      Inherit it (`is PoseidonEnsurer`) from the private-layer deploy scripts and call
///      `ensurePoseidon()` inside their broadcast, or run `EnsurePoseidon` below on its own:
///      `forge script script/Poseidon.s.sol:EnsurePoseidon --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast`
